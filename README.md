# Fitness Tracker

## Description

As a user I want to be able to view create and track my daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises and track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of my exercises. I should be able to see the results and the track information of my imputed workouts in my dashboard.
